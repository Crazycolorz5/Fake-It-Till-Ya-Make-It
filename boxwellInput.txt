Welcome to Washington High School! Please input your name:

Nice to meet you, Malloc. 
Good luck as your first day as a substitute teacher!
You enter the hallway outside the sciences classrooms.
You worry for a second that you won't be able to remember any students' names, but luckil
y you have all the class rosters!
Type help for a few possible commands, or look around to get started!
>>> help
help: gives a brief description of basic commands user can enter
quit: quits the demo
answer _: submits an answer to the current question
query _: queries Watson for given keyword/keyphrase
You can look around to see the environment around you.
Otherwise, just say what you want to do!
>>> look around
You are in the sciences hallway.
There are neighboring classrooms for the sciences and maths.
The arts hallway is on the other end.
>>> go to a classroom
Which classroom would you like to move to: math, biology, physics?
>>> math
You move to the Math classroom.

Steve is sitting at his desk, playing remotely with a hovercraft.
Holden is at his desk, studying a bit before class. He seems confused.
The teacher's desk is at the front of the room.
The door to the sciences hallway is near the teacher's desk.

In geometry, what's the name of a line segment that has its endpoints on the circle, but 
is not specifically filling any other requirement?
Need help? I'll let you look at my notes. They're in my backpack.
>>> look into Steve's backpack
You take Steve Boxwell's notes on circles. You attempt to read it, but
then decide to just send it to Watson to make sense of the handwriting automatically.
You got a document on circles!
>>> query line segment endpoints on circle
Result 1: Diameter: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and which passes thr
ough the centre; or the length of such a line segment, which is the largest distance betw
een any two points on the circle.

You forgot already? I asked you, what is the name of a line segment that has its endpoint
s on a circle?

I already knew that, but thanks anyway. You're not too bad.

So apparently the quadratic equation is a special equation, because it contains only one 
unknown. What's the word for that?
>>> answer univariate
That makes sense, like one variable. Thanks!
>>> look around
Steve is sitting at his desk. You think he's looking a bit smug. Maybe it's the fact that
 he has a hovercraft.
Holden is waiting impatiently for class to start.
The teacher's desk is at the front of the room.
The door to the sciences hallway is near the teacher's desk.

remember, Professor? (format: genus species)

You open the drawer and grab the lecture notes the regular teacher left you. To reduce pr

for analysis.
You got a document on the American Black Bear!

Hey there Prof! Say, since you're just subbing, could you help me with this question on m

As per the student's request, you search the web for an article on mitosis.
You grab the Wikipedia page and send it to IBM Watson for analysis.

The question was, what's the final phase of mitosis?
>>> query mitosis phase final
Result 1: Thus, a cell grows (G1), continues to grow as it duplicates its chromosomes (S)
, grows more and prepares for mitosis (G2), and finally divides (M) before restarting the
 cycle. All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by cyclins, cyclin-depend
ent kinases, and other cell cycle proteins.
Result 2: Thus, a cell grows (G<sub>1</sub>), continues to grow as it duplicates its chro
mosomes (S), grows more and prepares for mitosis (G<sub>2</sub>), and finally divides (M)
 before restarting the cycle. All these phases in the cell cycle are highly regulated by

Result 2: before mitosis. This occurs during the S phase of interphase. Chromosome duplic

When mitosis begins, the chromosomes condense and become visible.

Result 1: In cell biology, mitosis is a part of the cell cycle when replicated chromosome
s are separated into two new nuclei. In general, mitosis (division of the nucleus) is pre
ceded by the S stage
Result 2: to each other.
The process of mitosis is divided into stages corresponding to the completion of one set 
of activities and the start of the next. These stages are prophase, prometaphase, metapha
se, anaphase, and telophase.
